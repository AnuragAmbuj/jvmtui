Description: Beautiful TUI for JVM monitoring
 JVM-TUI brings powerful JVM monitoring to your terminal with a keyboard-driven
 interface. Monitor heap usage, garbage collection, memory pools, and threads in
 real-time - perfect for SSH sessions and production environments where GUI tools
 aren't available.
 .
 Features:
  - Auto-discovery of running JVMs
  - Real-time heap usage, GC statistics, and memory pool metrics
  - Keyboard-driven interface with Vim-style navigation
  - No JVM agents required - uses standard JDK tools (jcmd, jstat, jps)
  - SSH-friendly and lightweight
 .
 This package requires JDK 11+ with command-line tools (jcmd, jstat, jps)
 to be installed on the system.
